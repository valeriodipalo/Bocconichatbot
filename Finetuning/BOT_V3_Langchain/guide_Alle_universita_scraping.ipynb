It changed the structure of both the study plan and the degree programs in the\\nfields of Economics and Management from one long four-year cycle to the so-called 3 plus 2,\\ndivided into two cycles (undergraduate and graduate).\\n\\nThe result of a homogeneous course of studies in Europe was the free movement of students\\nwithin universities during their educational training and subsequently the movement of\\ngraduates in the world of work.\\n\\nThe two study cycles are to be considered separate; at the end of each, a final exam is\\nrequired, as well as the awarding of a diploma and the certification of the title obtained.\\n\\nOnce the 3-year cycle has been completed the student can decide whether to enter the world\\nof work or continue his/her university studies by enrolling in a graduate program (Master of\\nScience or a Specialized Master).\\n\\nSince the start of the Bocconi University graduate programs, the selection process has been\\ndistinct from that of the undergraduate one; therefore, admission to an undergraduate degree\\nprogram does not imply the automatic admission to a Master of Science program.\\n\\nThe selection criteria for graduate programs are defined by the administration during the\\nannual plan of activities and are published on the website and in the Bocconi information\\npack before the candidates\\' assessment procedure takes place.\\n\\nFor the 2023-2024 academic year, the Undergraduate School offers the following three-year\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\nBachelor of Science programs:\\n\\n4 Bachelor of Science programs which are part of the \"Management\" field of study\\n(no.
