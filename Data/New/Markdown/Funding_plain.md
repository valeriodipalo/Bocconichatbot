### What are the benefits associated with applying for an ISU Bocconi scholarship?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4410220128658-What-are-the-benefits-associated-with-applying-for-an-ISU-Bocconi-scholarship

##### 32

What are the benefits associated with eligibility for the ISU Bocconi scholarship?

The ISU Bocconi Scholarship benefit for all eligible students consists of:

> a cash payment of the amount defined by the Lombardy Region for a free daily meal;

> the possibility to purchase meals at a preferential rate;

> any additional benefits (integration for internships, contribution for international mobility programs, etc.) under the conditions set out in the ISU Bocconi Application Requirements and Regulations.

Students who are ISU eligible, recipients and non-recipients, by virtue of their eligibility, are also entitled to a full tuition and fees waiver from Bocconi University (with the exception of ISU eligible students in the first year fuori corso who are granted 50% of the tuition and fees exemption) and the total exemption from the payment of the regional tax and the enrollment fee.

 

In the final ranking, I am an eligible recipient student. What am I entitled to?

In addition to all the benefits listed above, students who are eligible recipients are also entitled to a cash stipend of varying amount. 

For more details on the cash stipend, please visit the dedicated page of our website.

 

In the final ranking, I am an eligible student. Am I required to pay the first installment advance?

All students, including those eligible (recipients and non-recipients) for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship, are required to pay the first installment-advance to finalize their enrollment in the academic year. The advance payment will then be refunded to ISU eligible students (recipients and non-recipients) by the end of December on the bank account in the student's name that has been indicated on the Punto Blu.

 

I received the 712-euro cash payment for a free daily meal. How can I spend it?

The amount of 712 euros for free daily meals is transferred by the University to the bank account of ISU eligible students and it can be spent physically to eat anywhere.

In order to spend this sum of money, it is therefore not necessary to transfer it onto the Bocconi card, but it is possible to spend it like any other amount of money.

Only if interested, ISU eligible students can use this sum to purchase meals at a preferential rate by transferring them onto the Bocconi card through the UbsStore online tool, to be used in the provided dining areas.

For more information on the preferential rate canteen service, please visit the dedicated page of our website.

### Renewal and bonus credits

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4417365858706-Renewal-and-bonus-credits

##### 33

Is the ISU Bocconi Scholarship renewed automatically for subsequent years?
No, it is necessary to submit a specific application every year and meet all the requirements laid out in the ISU Bocconi Scholarship Application Requirements and Regulations.
 
I am in the first year of my degree and I have not managed to reach the minimum number of credits needed by August 10 to confirm the benefit retrospectively for the first year. Can I use bonus credits?
Students enrolled in the first year of a Bachelor of Science, Integrated Master of Arts in Law or Master of Science program CANNOT use bonus credits to confirm the benefit retrospectively for the first year in addition to the credits they already earned. First-year students who, due to a lack of credits, fail to confirm the benefit at the end of the first year are subject to the revocation for insufficient academic merit.
For further information on this scenario, we invite you to visit our ([Revocation of the benefit”](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/current+students/services/funding/2023-24+revocation+of+the+benefit) webpage.
 
I have applied for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship for a year subsequent to the first. If I do not have enough credits by August 10 (before the start of the academic year), can I use the bonus credits to reach the required number?
In order to reach the minimum merit requirements needed to request the Right to University Education financial aid, students of years subsequent to the first can resort to bonus credits in addition to those they already earned. The number of bonus credits available varies depending on the enrollment year as well as on the program, as indicated on the [“Bonus Credits”] (https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/current+students/services/funding/2023-24+bonus+credits) webpage.
 
I have been eligible for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship ever since my undergraduate years. I have applied for ISU for a year of Master's degree subsequent to the first. Can I use bonus credits that I left over from my undergraduate years?
Yes, students enrolled in Master of Science programs can use any residual bonus credits not used during their Bachelor of Science program. If they never used bonus credits during their Bachelor of Science program, they may use up to 15 credits.

### Compatibility with other funding opportunities

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4410219678226-Compatibility-with-other-funding-opportunities

##### 34

Are there any funding opportunities that are compatible with the ISU Bocconi Scholarship?

The ISU Bocconi Scholarship may not be combined with similar forms of economic aid provided by Bocconi University or other private or public bodies. In these cases students have the option of choosing one assistance or the other. Exceptions will be made for scholarships granted by Italian or international institutions aimed at integrating with experiences abroad the study or research activity of candidates as well as awards given by Universities to outstanding students enrolled in specific excellence programs.

However, it is possible to apply for Bocconi student loans for the same academic year when eligible for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship.

2. I am a student whose ISU Bocconi Scholarship has been revoked. Can I apply for preferential rate canteen service in the academic year following the revocation?
Yes, students who meet the economic requirements and intend to apply for preferential rate canteen service only can submit a specific online application during the dedicated period, even if they are not eligible for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship.
For more information on these economic requirements, we invite you to visit our (“Economic requirements”](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/current+students/services/funding/2023-2024+economic+requirements) webpage.
 
3. I am a student whose ISU Bocconi Scholarship has been revoked. Can I submit an ISU application in the academic year following the revocation?

### I am a student in the final year of my degree and I fear I might not be able to graduate by the last available graduation session. How much do I owe?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4417330638866-I-am-a-student-in-the-final-year-of-my-degree-and-I-fear-I-might-not-be-able-to-graduate-by-the-last-available-graduation-session-How-much-do-I-owe

##### 36

Students who fail to graduate by the last available graduation session are required to enroll in the following academic year as first-year "fuori corso" students.

Students who are enrolled as first-year "fuori corso" students and are eligible for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship for that same academic year are exempt from paying the enrollment fee and will only have to pay 50% of the ordinary fees target, depending on the graduation session.

Therefore, if you think you will not be able to graduate by the last available graduation session, we suggest that you apply for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship for the following academic year regardless, in the event that you may have to enroll in the following academic year as a first-year "fuori corso" student.

However, please be informed that in order to be included in the ISU Scholarship ranking and therefore to be entitled to the benefit in case of eligibility, you will have to be regularly enrolled in the new academic year by September, before the ISU Scholarship results are announced.

For more information on the payment of academic tuition and fees for final-year students, we invite you to visit our website section, where you can find the specific regulation.

## Partial Exemptions

### What is a named scholarship?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4407872955794-What-is-a-named-scholarship

##### 37

For the provision of partial exemptions, Bocconi University commits its own resources and also kind donations and gifts from companies, Alumni, individuals and Foundations. Donors sometimes wish to identify deserving individual students to associate their support rather than allocating their contribution generically to a project. For this reason, the recipients of partial exemption are often associated with a Named scholarship.

Note:
In these cases, the Bocconi University Development Unit contacts the named scholarship recipient in order to share with them any reserved advantages and opportunities envisaged by the specific Donor (e.g. academic or extra-academic activities). To facilitate possible contacts with Donors, candidates will be asked to upload a version of their CV that can be shared with Donors.

## Fees relief target

### What is the fees relief target? Which benefits does it entail?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9569773022610-What-is-the-fees-relief-target-Which-benefits-does-it-entail

##### 38

In the context of support of studies addressed to students, Bocconi University foresees for both national and international students enrolled in Bachelor of Science programs or Integrated Master of Arts in Law (first year and subsequents) the possible assignment of a reduction on the ordinary fees target called "Fees relief target".
This benefit foresees a reduction on the ordinary fees target according to 3 different fees relief targets.
The Fees, Funding and Housing office assesses the [economic and asset condition](https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9605244737298-What-does-determine-my-fees-relief-target) of the (Bocconi conventional family household)[https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9606910211474-How-the-Bocconi-conventional-family-household-is-composed] of the student and defines the benefit to be assigned.
The different percentages of funding go approximately from 60% to 20% and they are always related to the situation and, usually, defined as follows:
	•	1st fees relief target: foreseen for economic and asset situations below € 64.000
	•	2nd fees relief target: foreseen for economic and asset situations between € 64.001 and € 101.000
	•	3rd fees relief target: between € 101.001 and € 146.000.
Attention: the income-asset ranges indicated above apply exclusively to students enrolled in the 1st year 2023-24 in a Bachelor degree course and/or Integrated Master of Arts in Law and who have submitted "Fees relief target application a.y. 2023-24".
Given that the evaluation of the economic and asset situation is carried out by the Fees, Funding and Housing office based on the documentation provided by the student in the dedicated online procedure, applications submitted after the deadline and/or according to different modalities will not be evaluated for the assignment of the benefit._x000B_In addition, this benefit will not be applicable to students having an economic and asset situation above € 135.000 (limit above which the ordinary fees target is foreseen), to students who will submit incomplete documentation, that will provide information non corresponding to what highlighted by the relevant documents or with what subsequently verified by the University. To all these students, the ordinary fees target will be applied.
Please note that this benefit is compatible with other forms of exemption and/or funding offered by Bocconi University (15% reduction for siblings/spouses and the children of Bocconi/Egea employees, possible merit-based financial aid, scholarships and/or exemptions assigned by Bocconi according with agreements with partner institutions, other benefit assigned by the University for a.y. 2023-24).
 
How to apply for "fees relief target"
In order to submit the "Fees relief target" application, students had to apply according to their admission round as follows: 
Application expired
 
Students enrolled in a year after the first and interested in a fees relief should have submitted "Fees revaluation application for a.y. 2023-24" according to deadlines and methods provided in the [dedicated article](https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9609296712082-Can-I-apply-for-fees-revaluation-for-a-y-2023-24-for-students-from-the-second-academic-year). 
 
What are the criteria for renewal, revocation and loss of the benefit?
Renewal
The assigned benefit will be automatically renewed for the whole legal duration of the program (Bachelor of Science or Integrated Master of Arts in Law Program). Therefore the fees relief target assigned for the 1st year of enrollment (or for subsequent year in case of transferring students) will be applied for all the subsequent years of enrollment, except for possible request of fees target revaluation made by the student or by the University._x000B__x000B_Please note that this benefit is not foreseen for Master of Science programs.
 
Revocation and loss
The assignment of the fees relief target will be revoked in the following cases:
>acceptance, in any year of course, of a different benefit of an amount equal to or greater than the fees relief target assigned by Bocconi University; in this regard it is specified that in the event that the student should subsequently lose this new benefit, the fees relief target can be restored;
> verifications carried out by the Fees, Funding and Housing Office reveal false documentation and declarations made by the student for the assignment of the fees relief target: the revocation shall take effect starting from the moment in which the illicit behavior took place and shall entail the full payment (at the ordinary fees target) of due tuition and fees starting from the academic year in which the student benefited from the fees relief target following the false documentation and/or declarations (articles 71 and 75 of Italian D.P.R. 445/2000).

Students enrolled in years after the first
The request of relief on the ordinary fees target may also be submitted by subsequent years students through the "Fees revaluation application".

To define the Conventional Family Household we must refer to the regulations detailed below:

 
1. Student in Official Family Household with both parents or with the only living parent

everyone listed on the student's "Official Family Household"
other children financially dependent on their parents even if they not belong to student's Official Family Household.
 

2. Student in Official Family Household whose parents are separated, divorced or not cohabiting

If the student’s parents are separated, divorced or not cohabiting (even if not married), the Conventional Family Household is composed of:

the student;
everyone listed on the student's "Official Family Household";
the parent not belonging to the student's "Official Family Household";
other children financially dependent on their parents even if they not belong to student's Official Family Household
The Conventional Family Household is composed of the parent not belonging to student's Official Family Household, even if student is in the Official Family Household with only one parent. 

Their income bracket will be determined on the basis of cumulative income/property.

the student;
everyone listed on the Official Family Household of both parents;

other children financially dependent on their parents even if they not belong to student's Official Family Household.
 

4. Married student

Married students whose income/property are adequate to support their new family are considered independent from their family of origin and thus the income/property of the family of origin will not be considered. Therefore, the following people are considered members of the Conventional Family Household:

the student;
everyone listed on the student's Official Family Household.
Different situations will be considered case by case.

## Fees relief target

### What does determine my fees relief target?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9605244737298-What-does-determine-my-fees-relief-target

##### 42

The economic and asset condition of the Bocconi conventional family household is defined using the evaluation method established by the University, upon controlling the correctness and completeness of all the required documentation. 

 

In order to determine the fees relief target for a.y. 2023-24, the following elements must be added together:

Gross income 2021
In detail, for each member of the Bocconi conventional family household, Bocconi University considers the sum of total gross income received in 2021 in your country and abroad (including incomes which are fiscally exempt and which are not included on income tax returns due to their nature). We specify that we consider the gross income even in case of income fiscally exempt, earned without a withholding tax.

Large family households, with more than two children who are completely financially dependent upon their parents (at 100%), shall benefit from a reduction of € 6,000.00 per child from the incomes calculation, for the third child onwards. The reduction request must be submitted to the Fees, Funding and Housing Office during the process of the fees reduction target application, enclosing the specific form.

Real estate and movable assets 2021 as a percentage
In detail for each member of the Bocconi family household, Bocconi University considers real estate properties and movable assets owned in 2021 in your country and abroad as a percentage.

Please note that with reference to real estate, the calculation will also be applied to housing with commodate for use or right to reside.

Movable assets consist of different items listed on the following webpage.

The applicable percentage depends on the prevalence and/or the significance of the real estate properties and the asset values compared to the income arising from working and/or entrepreneurial activities and consists of 20% or 10%.  For the first home with a mortgage to pay off, 5% is exceptionally applied (rather than 20% or 10%). The existence of a mortgage must be officially documented.

Evaluation of entrepreneurial, professional and artistic activities
Evaluation of entrepreneurial, professional and artistic activities, also deriving from shares, on the basis of structural characteristics, sectoral parameters and any other important elements.

All the entrepreneurial, professional and artistic activities are considered, also deriving from the possession of shares, regardless the geographical location (in your country or abroad).

 

The summation of the elements listed above establishes the economic and asset condition of the Bocconi conventional family household, which will lead to a possible assignment in a fees relief target, with reference to the income-asset ranges indicated in the tables available in the section Fees > Fees payment.

 

The amounts and installments as well as the income-asset ranges for the a.y. 2023-24 are available in the tuition and fees section inside B in touch.

### Can I apply for fees revaluation for a.y. 2023-24? (for students from the second academic year)

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9609296712082-Can-I-apply-for-fees-revaluation-for-a-y-2023-24-for-students-from-the-second-academic-year

##### 43

Students regularly enrolled in a.y. 2023-24 in an year after the first in Bachelor of Science or in an Integrated Master of Arts in Law can apply for a fees relief target through a "Fees revaluation application a.y. 2023-24", available from 28 June 2023 to 12 July 2023.

In case the student already applied for a fees relief in previous academic years, then the fees target can be reassessed, upon request from students, only when their economic-asset situation has significantly changed compared to the last documented. Changes in assets of over € 40,000 compared to the situation previously presented must be justified and documented.

In order to be able to apply for fees revaluation, the financial position of the student must be regularized (all the payments must have been settled). 

The fees target assigned to the student after the application will consider the same elements indicated in the article "What does determine my fees relief target?" (gross income, percentage of movable and real estate assets, evaluation of entrepreneurial, professional and artistic activities) referring to the 2021 fiscal year. The required documentation in detail is available in the article "What is the necessary documentation to apply for fees revaluation for a.y. 2023-24?"

 

How to apply for "Fees revaluation application a.y. 2023-24"
To submit the fees revaluation application, students must complete the procedure as follows from 28/06/2023 to 12/07/2023:

APPLICATION EXPIRED (available from 28/06/2023 to 12/07/2023)

1. Access the "Fees revaluation application a.y. 2023-2024" through the link available only during the application submission period.


2. Enter data in the online procedure.

Fill in all the required information, with particular reference to conventional family household, gross income received in 2021, entrepreneurial activities, movable and immovable assets 2021, etc.


3. Upload all the required documents within the above mentioned period.

No benefit can be assigned to students who present incomplete documentation, who communicate data that do not correspond to the results highlighted by the documentation or that do not correspond to what will emerge from the University's checks.

The Fees, Funding and Housing Office will assess the student's economic-asset condition on the basis of the documentation and information presented in the online application.


4. Complete the procedure by clicking “Confirm data” and “Submit application” within the last day of the application period. On the right of the page, you will see “You have confirmed data on "mm/dd/yyyy” and “You have submitted application on "mm/dd/yyyy". A green bar will appear under these messages.

Any documents received after the deadline or with different methods than those described, will not be taken in consideration.


5. After having completed the online procedure, students must check the “Notification area” of the Fees Funding and Housing section of "My Application" to find out if the office has sent any communications.

 

Results
The outcome of the "Fees revaluation application a.y. 2023-24" will be available in My Application, within the online application, by the end of October 2023.

The amounts of academic tuition and fees, with relative deadlines, will be available online through the yoU@B Agenda and Punto Blu, in the "Financial Situation-Payments" section after the definitive assignment of the fees target, starting from November 2024.

The benefit assigned for the academic year 2023-2024 will be included in the student's financial situation, which can be viewed at the Punto Blu (> administrative area> Fees, Funding and Housing) ONLY after the Fees, Funding and Housing Office has verified that the student is regularly enrolled in the first year or regularly enrolled in the year following the first to a.y. 2023-2024. For this reason, students who in the academic year 2023-2024 will be "enrolled with reserve" (or have enrollment subject to reserve) will not be able to view in the system the benefit assigned for the academic year 2023-2024.

 

Renewal
From 2nd year enrollment onwards the same fees as last year will be applied.

Consequently, no tax forms or integrative documentation need to be submitted, except in the cases of a re-evaluation being made to the formerly assigned fees target.

Fees target can be reassessed, upon request from students, only when their economic-family estate situation has changed to such a measure that it is necessary to lower the fees target and under the modalities summarized below.

 
Revocation
Students will automatically lose the fees relief target assigned in case of:

> assignment and/or acceptance of a different benefit of an amount equal to or greater than the fees relief target assigned by Bocconi University; in the event that the student should subsequently lose this new benefit, the original fees relief target can be restored;

> verifications carried out by the Fees, Funding and Housing Office reveal false declarations made by the student for the assignment of the fees relief target: the revocation shall take effect starting from the moment in which the illicit behavior took place and shall entail the full payment of due tuition and fees starting from the academic year in which the student benefited from the waiver following false declarations (articles 71 and 75 of Italian D.P.R. 445/2000).

 

 

In any case, we invite the students to check the complete regulation published on the site, available at the following link.

## ISEE/ISEEU parificato certificate

### ISEE: detailed information

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4407770347282-ISEE-detailed-information

##### 44

What is the “University Use” ISEE?
The ISEE is the Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator that allows the economic situation of families to be compared (see FAQ on ISEEU parificato if you cannot apply for the ISEE).

The ISEE is finalized by INPS and included in a document called “ISEE Certification," a protection tool that certifies the truthfulness of the personal, income and financial information contained therein.

The ISEE certification is for citizens residing in Italy with income produced in Italy, to be able to access all types of request for relief on ordinary tuition at Bocconi University and, at a national level, for certain social services (or benefits), accessible only in the presence of certain requirements.

To access university benefits, the student must obtain the ISEE certificate for the student's right to study (“University Use” ISEE referring to the student's fiscal code).

An ISEE certificate valid for university purposes has the following characteristics that must be ascertained by the student:

the document was issued on a date after 1 January of the year in which it is submitted;
the document was issued for subsidized benefits for the right to university study in favor of the student requesting the benefit;
it is free of omissions/discrepancies reported by INPS.
 
Who issues the ISEE?
You can request the issuance of the ISEE certificate:

directly from the INPS website (by accessing the appropriate service using the device PIN code)
from a CAF (Tax Assistance Center)
from a chartered accountant, accounting expert or labor consultant.
 
What documents are needed to obtain the ISEE certificate?
The necessary documents are communicated by the CAF and/or the professional in charge based on the specific family situation.

The data needed for defining the certification are partly self-declared (such as personal data and assets held at 31 December) and partly acquired by the Revenue Agency (total income for IRPEF purposes) and by INPS.

For self-declared information, the person who completes a Self-Certification (DSU) assumes responsibility, including criminal, for what has been declared.

Suggestions: 
Here are some useful tips for drawing up a correct ISEE certification:

In the event that your parents are owners of a partnership and/or hold shares in a joint stock company, the value of the net assets must be included in the DSU (pursuant to DPCM 159/2013).
If you received an exempt scholarship in the ISEE tax year of reference, this must always be indicated in part FC24 of the DSU (e.g. exempt scholarship received in 2021 for ISEE 2023). Please note that with regard to the right to study grants provided by Bocconi, the Self-Certification (DSU) referring to the exempt scholarship received in one year is automatically sent by email directly from the Administration & Finance office of the University in May of the following year.
The family unit is defined in accordance with D.P.C.M. 05/12/2013, no. 159, art. 3 and art. 8 and the INPS Circular 18/12/2014 no. 171. In particular, with reference to the date of signing of the DSU, the family unit is made up of the members of the registry family and in any case the student and all the persons present on the family certificate, even if not linked by kinship or relationship. However, we recommend that you contact the CAF or the professional in charge who will be able to identify the correct composition of the family unit pursuant to D.P.C.M. 159/2013
Deadlines:  
Normally the ISEE certificate is issued in about 15 days: it is therefore advisable to request the ISEE before the deadline for the funding application that you intend to submit. The ISEE can be requested starting from 15 January of each year for funding which is usually awarded by November of the same calendar year.

## ISEE/ISEEU parificato certificate

### Do you need an ISEE to apply for funding at Bocconi University?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/4407780971538-Do-you-need-an-ISEE-to-apply-for-funding-at-Bocconi-University

##### 45

To request any type of funding for a.y. 2023-24 for the payment of tuition and fees, it is always necessary to submit, together with the application for the specific funding, an ISEE certificate for "University Use." The certification is one of the documents needed to determine the economic situation of the student and family but it is NOT the only element that will be taken into consideration.

The ISEE, like all other documents, cannot be sent by email or delivered in paper form but must always be uploaded online in the funding application that you intend to submit.

By itself, therefore, the indicator of the economic situation indicated in the ISEE Certificate is not sufficient to determine the fees relief target or another type of benefit. 

Important: if the ISEE is less than € 24,335.11 and your ISPEE is no higher than € 52.902,43. check the possibility of obtaining an ISU Bocconi Scholarship. 
For more information, please see the website.

Deadlines: The deadlines for submitting the funding application in which you are interested should be checked online.

##### 46

The ISEEU parificato is the document that must be requested when the ISEE calculation cannot be carried out. It can be requested by Italian and non-Italian students who are not residents in Italy or by non-Italian students who are residents in Italy, but are not autonomous and with family members residing abroad.

Suggestion: The ISEEU Parificato can be issued by a CAF and also by the Milan Tax Services Center (CSF) located in Corso di Porta Vittoria, 43, which has an agreement with Bocconi University.
To request the ISEEU parificato be issued for a.y. 2023-24, students must send in a single email a copy of all the documents required to the address documentsise.bocconi@cgil.lombardia.it.

Eligible Students
Academic profiles considered to be amongst the top applicants were considered for merit-based financial aid based on the admissions application submitted to Bocconi University. A separate application is not required. The evaluation will primarily be based on the candidate’s academic achievement. In addition to academic achievement, the complete dossier provided to the Admissions Office will be evaluated. The selection of awardees will be carried out by a Committee, nominated by the Rector, including the Dean of the Undergraduate School and the Dean for International Affairs, whose decisions about numbers, amounts and recipients are final and cannot be appealed.

Bocconi University implements work-study opportunities offering its students the opportunity to work inside the University, according to art. 11 of L. 29 March 2012 no. 68

These activities may be connected to services offered by the University and exclude teaching activities, the undertaking of examinations or activities that imply the assumption of administrative responsibilities.

The work undertaken will not in any way constitute formal employment and will not result in any evaluation for the purposes of undertaking any role at Bocconi University or for participation in open employment competitions.

Students may not work more than 200 hours during the academic year 2023-2024 (November 2023–October 2024).

As foreseen at art. 11, comma 3 and 4 of the Legislative Decree no.68/2012, for participation in work-study opportunities, students will be selected considering both merit and economic requirements.

 

Addressees of 200 Hours Work-Study Program

200 Hours Work-Study Program activities are addressed primarily to students enrolled in AY  2023-2024 in years after the first of a Bachelor, Master of Science and Integrated Master of Arts in Law programs who are eligible for ISU Bocconi Scholarship for AY 2023-2024and who have shown interest in 200 Hours Work-Study Program for 2023-2024 a.y.

 

Deadlines and methods for 2023-2024 AY

The avaibility to complete 200-hours collaboration, which may be requested by Bocconi University only if necessary, must be communicated through a specific expression of interest for carrying out these activities.

This interest can be expressed by completing an online application procedure for an ISU Bocconi scholarship for the 2023-2024 a.y.

After the deadline for applying for 2023-2024 a.y. ISU scholarship, interest can no longer be expressed for completing a part-time 200-hours collaboration for the 2023-2024 a.y.

Please note that an expression of interest is not binding and does not affect eligibility for an ISU scholarship.

 
Allocation of work-study positions

In accordance with art. 11, comma 3 and 4 of the Legislative Decree no.68/2012, allocation of work-study positions will follow a ranking established with the same criteria as the ones foreseen for the ISU Bocconi Scholarship ranking for non-first year students, as indicated at art. 10 of ISU Bocconi Scholarship application requirements and regulations AY 2023-2024.

On the basis of the ranking list formed by the Fees, Funding and Housing Office, eligible students will be contacted by the Faculty & Staff Administration, starting with the first student in the ranking and continuing with second and subsequent, until exhaustion of available positions.

Students selected must sign an act of commitment in two copies - one for the Office and one for the student.

The person in charge of the office requesting the student support is responsible for supervising the work undertaken by the student and for the coordination of the work.

 

Payment

The hourly rate, tax-exempt pursuant to article 13 of law 2 December 1991 n. 390, is determined annually by the University Board, depending on University budget availability.

For 2023-2024 academic year the hourly rate is € 8,00.

 

End of the Work-Study position

At the end of the period indicated on the student’s commitment, the work activity will finish without further communication. There is no implicit renewal.

The work activity will automatically stop after graduation or withdrawal from Bocconi, or if what indicated in the “cancellation of the work-study position” paragraph occurs.

• suspend the work-study position;

• cancel the work assignment.

If the student incurs disciplinary sanctions greater than a written warning for infringement of Bocconi University regulations, his/her work assignment will be cancelled.

### Are there reductions for siblings attending Bocconi programs in case of simultaneous enrollment in the same academic year?

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/9624983519506-Are-there-reductions-for-siblings-attending-Bocconi-programs-in-case-of-simultaneous-enrollment-in-the-same-academic-year

##### 61

General rules
Students can benefit from further fee reductions through percentage reductions or evaluation of a special family situation.
In case of simultaneous enrollment in the same academic year for 2023-24, attending any of the Bocconi University Bachelor of Science programs, Law program, the four-year degree programs, or the Master of Science programs during the same academic, it is possible to benefit of a 15% reduction in university tuition due.
The 15% reductions cannot be combined each other and with other discounts offered by Bocconi University (with the exception of the “Fees relief target application”). In case of brothers, sisters and spouses, if one of the enrolled students is fully or partially exempt from the payment of university tuition and fees, the other student is not entitled to make use of the 15% reduction on his/her tuition.
Students will have to submit the application for 15% reduction" exclusively in the period between February 1 and December 4, 2023 and only after completing the enrollment procedure for the a.y. 2023-24.
The application can be submitted for a.y. 2023-24 starting from 1st February and by and no later than 4 December 2023.
The request must be submitted exclusively by one of the brothers/sisters/spouses who are simultaneous enrolled inthe same academic year.
The payment slip will be updated by 15th december 2023.
 
Attention: the application can be submitted only after completing the enrollment procedure for the a.y. 2023-24 and therefore, sibling who will be the first to be formally enrolled from January 2023, can submit the application starting from 1 February without waiting for the period established by Academic services for enrollment in the academic years following the first.
 
The 15% reduction must be submitted each academic year? 
The reduction is automatically renewed for the entire legal duration of the study program.
Therefore, in case of enrollment in academic years subsequent to the first, the application must not be resubmitted, even in case of enrollment in a new degree program (transition from a Bachelor to a Master of Science program) by one of the beneficiaries of the reduction.

### Assignment criteria

#### https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/13855892627730-Assignment-criteria

##### 64

Università Bocconi is committed to promoting inclusion also through the support of students who, despite being economically disadvantaged, wish to have an experience abroad.
Cash grants are assigned within the limits of available resources and until the mobility funds allocated at national and international level are exhausted.
In determining the amount of the grants, the University must also refer to the guidelines set out by each entity allocating international mobility funds.
The amount of the grant takes into account, besides the students’ economic situation:
	•	[Destination](https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/13860759493522-Grant-amounts-by-destination)
	•	Duration of the experience, as attested by the certificate of arrival/departure
In particular, among all participants in international programs (Exchange, CEMS-MIM, Themis, DD Essec and other Joint/Double Degree programs) the "fewer opportunities" group is identified, which includes students awarded the following benefits in the academic year 2022-2023:
	•	ISU Bocconi scholarship
	•	1° fees relief target
	•	need-based exemptions from 60% to 100% on ordinary Bocconi fees
NOTE: Participants in a mobility program who benefit from one of the funding opportunities described above during academic year 2023-2024 without having been recipients in academic year 2022-2023, will receive the possible support grant top-up associated to the "fewer opportunities" group only at the end of the experience.
Students belonging to this group will receive an inclusion support grant (a flat-rate top-up equal to 250 euros per month) in addition to the [monthly amounts](https://bit.unibocconi.it/hc/en-us/articles/13860759493522-Grant-amounts-by-destination) established per destination.
Moreover, "fewer opportunities" students heading to other destinations (group 4) may receive a cash contribution for their travel costs at the end of the experience, if funds are available.
For the academic year 2023-2024, students not belonging to the "fewer opportunities" category will be considered as described below.
Taking into account the capacity of the international Erasmus+ funding program, received for the academic year 2023-2024, and in compliance with the guidelines provided for by said fund, for this year also students not belonging to the "fewer opportunities" group in mobility towards destinations falling within groups 1, 2 and 3 may be considered for the allocation of available funds.
With reference to students heading to destinations within group 4, it is specified that by virtue of the funds received to date, it will also be possible to support students who, while not falling within the "fewer opportunities" group, have been assigned a need-based benefit (2nd or 3rd fees relief target).

##### 67

The payment of the mobility grant will take place according to the timing and methods set out in the individual calls for funds. The disbursement may be made in two instalments, an advance payment upon departure (normally equal to at least 3 months) and an adjustment payment upon return from the program (defined on the basis of the actual months spent abroad) or in a single payment upon return from the program.

In both cases, the payment will be made exclusively by bank transfer to an Italian bank account in the name of or jointly held by the recipient student. For this reason, we recommend that you complete the online tax procedure – “regime fiscale” available on the following page: https://regimefiscale.unibocconi.it

You will need to use the following credentials for the first login:

User: Bocconi

Password: datifiscali

Change/customize Username and password for each subsequent login and complete all sections of the form

- If you do not have a VAT number, to the question "Will services be billed as an Associate Firm?" please answer NO

- In the Fiscal Residence section, indicate your place of residence in the current year and as the "start date" enter January 1 of the current year. Consider that if you spend more than 183 days in Italy in the current year, from January to December, your tax residence is Italy.

- If your tax residence is in Italy, in the last section you will have to answer 3 questions: choose "NO" for the first two and "YES" for the last one ("Will you have to receive an Erasmus+ scholarship")

- If the procedure does not allow you to save your profile, your account probably already exists (it may have been created ex officio): click on "Edit a previous statement" and then on "Retrieve password". Use your personal e-mail. To reset your password, you must complete your personal information. Then, once the password has been reset, you will have to enter again by clicking on “Edit a previous statement”.

IMPORTANT: In the "METHOD OF PAYMENT" section, you will find the check option selected, please change it by selecting the bank transfer/transfer option and entering an account in your name or co-owned by you. The "check" option is no longer eligible.

If your account already exists and you just need to update the payment method (check is not allowed): click on "Edit a previous statement" and use your personal credentials to enter the form.

PLEASE NOTE: Students who have not completed the tax scheme will not be considered for payment of the mobility grant.

Please note: in the event that you withdraw from the program at a later date than the payment of the grant, or the actual period of the experience abroad is less than the monthly payments received, you will be required to refund these sums.

##### 72

Six months after the last installment has been allocated, or, if before, after the study program has been completed, the recipient will be given one year during which neither capital nor interest will be required to be paid.

In the event withdrawal or transfer to another University, the grace period shall run from the date on which the granting Bank has been informed of such circumstances.

 

Before the end of the bridge period, students must go to the branch where the loan was opened and determine the amortization schedule for paying back the loan. The amounts used will accrue interest which will be debited to the current account and capitalized annually. The payback schedule may not exceed 180 months and will take place through monthly installments with a fixed amount, including capital and interest. Students will have the option of paying off the debt in advance, all or in part, without any additional cost.
