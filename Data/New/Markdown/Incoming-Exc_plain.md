In order to help students plan their departure, the ISD provides every semester an earliest departure date. By this date one exam for each course will be scheduled. Since students must sit their exams according to Bocconi rules only and during the official examination sessions, we strongly suggest that departures are not planned before this date, in order to avoid any issue concerning the unlikely possibility of a last minute exam scheduling change. The earliest departure dates for each semester are available at:[webpage]( www.ir.unibocconi.eu/calendar). Any departure planned before this date is under the student's responsibility.

In order to prove you are covered you need to provide a declaration from your insurance carrier confirming coverage abroad for the minimum amount provided by the law. Please note that Bocconi university does not sell medical insurances. However, the ISD will provide you with more information on health insurance policies you can subscribe to.
