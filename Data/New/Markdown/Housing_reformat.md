If you have succeeded in selecting a Residence and room type and saved the section, but at the time of "Submit data" another student has taken the last available place for the Residence and/or type you selected, the red "Submit data" button remains visible: this means that, even if you have already expressed and saved a preference in the "Residence and room type" section, your reservation was not successful due to lack of availability.
Because of this, you were not able to confirm the data, so you will have to:
	•	re-enter the "Residence and Room Type" section;
	•	select a new option;
	•	save the data on the section again by clicking on "SAVE";
	•	confirm the data for the new selection by clicking on the red "Submit data" button.
If in searching for a new option to select all available places are taken, the system would continue to show you, in the "Residence and Room Type" section, your original selection: this does NOT mean that the reservation was successful.

If you have booked accommodation in an Open reservation session and wish to confirm your reservation, remember that the reservation must be confirmed by 11.59 pm of the same evening. Proceed as follows:

Print, sign legibly in pen, scan and upload in the pre-set spaces all the documents you will find in the application
Proceed to pay the security deposit of 500 euros following the instructions and upload the receipt of payment
Click on "Submit Application"
 

If you receive notifications of missing or non-compliant documents
Print a new copy of the documents you need to integrate, fill it in, sign it as required and upload it to the "Additional documents" section. Warning: we advise you to proceed with this operation from your computer, uploading via mobile phone can cause problems. If you're having trouble, try switching browsers.

 
If you are having difficulty paying the security deposit
Don't worry, if you upload your documents by 11.59 pm the same evening, your reservation will still be confirmed: however, you must provide a copy of the receipt of the security deposit payment. If after changing browsers you encounter problems in paying via Paytool, you can make a bank transfer, using the following coordinates:

 

Reason: "Accommodation deposit" - Surname - Name - ID number
Beneficiary: Bocconi University
BANCA POPOLARE DI SONDRIO AG. 11 - Via Bocconi 8 - 20136 Milan
IBAN: IT55 E056 9601 6100 0000 2000 X88
SWIFT CODE: POSOIT22MIL

 
If you have previously paid another security deposit
It is not necessary to pay a new deposit, but only if the previous assignment took place during the same academic year and if it has not yet been reimbursed: in this case you can upload the copy of the previous receipt, and the office will verify its compliance. If, on the other hand, you have already obtained a refund of the previous security deposit, you must make a new payment.

 
Modification / cancellation of the reservation
After confirming the reservation of an accommodation, it is not possible to cancel the reservation or change the period of reservation. This means that you will not be able to request to extend your period of stay beyond the deadline indicated in the assignment confirmation phase, nor to request to bring forward the term of your assignment.

Of course, you will be able to have the accommodation at your convenience throughout your assignment period, even if you leave the accommodation early. From an administrative point of view, however, the accommodation will be formally assigned to you and you will be required to pay the accommodation fee for the entire period of the assignment.

Unfortunately, is not possible to request to change rooms or residences, as the number of places available in the residences is limited. For this reason it would not be possible to satisfy all requests of this type. If some technical aspect of your accommodation does not satisfy you or if you need maintenance, you can contact the management. They will do everything possible to solve any malfunctions or other problems encountered.

Tip: If you have not found yourself comfortable in the assigned accommodation and would like to change it, wait for the end of your assignment. Then, do not apply for confirmation for the following academic year and instead apply for a new admission, choosing among the application possibilities provided. In this way you will enter the pool for the assignment of a new accommodation.

If the student will be assigned a room in one of the Bocconi residence Halls for a.y. 2023-24 and during the same academic year you will take part in the Exchange program, Free Mover or he will participate in an off campus internship recognized by Bocconi University (verified by the competent offices), you can ask to temporarily sublet your room to another Bocconi student, who must be regularly enrolled in the a.y. 2023-24 in a Bachelor, Master of Science or Integrated Master of Arts in Law program, in correspondence of the period during which you will take part in the international experience. According to the agreement in place among the student who is temporary leaving the room and the subleasing student, it will be possible to sublet the room for one or more consecutive months, as long as they belong to the same semester (i.e. the period from September to January for the 1° semester and the period from January to June for the 2° semester).
The participation in the international program will be verified by the competent offices.
It is in student responsibility to find and indicate the name of a Bocconi student interested in temporarily occupying your room.

_x000B_Please note that:
	•	In case of rooms with shared bathroom, it is necessary that the subleasing student is of the same gender of the student who sublets his/her room.
	•	The room can be temporarily sublet only for full months.
	•	The student who will temporarily occupy the room will not have to meet economic or merit requirements._x000B_
In addition, and with reference to the due housing fees in case of temporary sublease:
	•	For students involved in the temporary sublease, the housing fees will be determined according to the monthly fee.
	•	Should the room be at the full rate, the student who will temporary occupy the room will pay for the accommodation exclusively at full rate (monthly fee).
Should the room be at preferential rate, the student who will temporary occupy the room will pay for the accommodation at full rate except in one of the following cases:
	•	The student who will temporarily occupy the room have applied for “preferential rate new admission a.y. 2023-23” (results in March 2023) and had an housing assignment (later not accepted by himself) or a non- housing assignment due to lack of places (note1). In these cases, at the time of the sublease/take over request, the student concerned may request to pay at the preferential rate.
or
	•	Should the room be at preferential rate, the student who will temporary occupy the room will be eligible for this rate only in the event that they have applied for the "ISU Bocconi Scholarship a.y. 2023-24" and that, following the result announcement of the final ranking list drawn up by the end of October 2023, they have been found eligible for the ISU Bocconi scholarship and has thus been assigned one of the ISU Bocconi brackets. In this case it is specified that the preferential rate will be applied only to the installments expected to expire AFTER the definition of its eligibility. If the incoming person has to pay an installment before the publication of the results of the ISU rankings - therefore who has agreed to take over for a period between September and December - he will have to pay the full rate.
Note1
The students received the following result: “we regret to inform you that is was NOT possible to assign you a room at preferential rate in one of our Bocconi on campus residences for the a.y. 2023-2024 as the number of applicants exceeded the number of available spots reserved for the right to university education assistance a.y. 2023-2024”

####### 27

Temporary sublease agreements are supervised by Fees, Funding and Housing Office only from an administrative point of view (collection and verification of the documentation, issue of the relevant period MAV payments, checks with the competent offices) and organizational point of view (communication with Bocconi residences concerning students involved and period of assignment) in order to facilitate and support students taking part in mobility programs or students looking for a temporary accommodation.


If a shared need of modification of the sublease agreement emerges after the deal is made (ex. extension or reduction of the period of stay), the students involved in the temporary sublease must jointly and in agreement with each other contact the Office, who will consider the request and carry out the necessary administrative procedures.


On the contrary, should any misunderstanding or conflicting needs arise between the students involved in the sublease, the Office will not intervene, and only the original agreement, formerly confirmed by the Office, will be considered as valid. The Office will intervene with the necessary administrative steps just in case the students involved in the sublease will find a mutual agreement among themselves, and when they will communicate to the Office the modification request jointly and in a written form.


Please note that it is not possible to cancel the temporary sublease agreement.
